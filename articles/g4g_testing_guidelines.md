* Developement team should avoid testing the software
	* Testing should always be performed by the testing team. The developer team should never test the software themselves. This is because after spending several hours building the software, it might unconsciously become too proprietorial and that might prevent seeing any flaws in the system.
* Software can never be 100% bug-free
	* Testing can never prove the software to 100% bug-free. In other words, there is no way to prove that the software is free of errors even after making a number of test cases.
* Start as early as possible
	* Testing should always starts parallelly alongside the requirement analysis process. This is crucial in order to avoid the problem of defect migration. It is important to determine the test objects and scope as early as possible.
* Prioritize sections
	* If there are certain critical sections, then it should be ensured that these sections are tested with the highest priority and as early as possible.
* The time available is limited
	* It must be kept in mind that the time available for testing is not unlimited and that an effective test plan is very crucial before starting the process of testing. There should be some criteria to decide when to terminate the process of testing. 
* Testing must be done with unexpected and negative inputs
	* Testing should be done with correct data and test cases as well as with flawed test cases to make sure the system is leak proof.
	* Testing should be done for functional as well as the non-functional requirements of the software product.
* Inspecting test results properly
	* Quantitative assessment of tests and their results must be done. The documentation should be referred to properly while validating the results of the test cases to ensure proper testing. Testing must be supported by automated tools and techniques as much as possible. 
* Validating assumptions
	* The test cases should never be developed on the basis of assumptions or hypothesis. They must always be validated properly. For instance, assuming that the software product is free from any bugs while designing test cases may result in extremely weak test cases.
