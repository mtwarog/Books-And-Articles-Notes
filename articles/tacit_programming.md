# Tacit programming (a.k.a point-free style)  
[Link to article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming)  
**Definition**: is a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments (or "points") on which they operate.  
* Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the arguments. 
## Characteristic
* Tacit programming is of theoretical interest, because the strict use of composition results in programs that are well adapted for equational reasoning. 
* It is also the natural style of certain programming languages, including APL and its derivatives, and concatenative languages such as Forth. 
* The lack of argument naming gives point-free style a reputation of being unnecessarily obscure, hence the epithet "pointless style".
* Important: UNIX scripting uses this paradigm with pipes
