* Kinds of control structures:
	* Conditional Branches: for choosing between two or more paths
		* if/else/else if/ternary operator and switch
	* Loops: iterate through multiple values / objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks
		* for, while, do while
	* Branching Statements: alter the flow of control in loops
		* break, continue
* If/else/else if
	* The if/else statement is the most basic of control structures, but can also be considered the very basis of decision making in programming.
* Ternary Operator
	* Is an expression, not a statement like if/else (means that it is evaluated and has value)
* Switch
	* If we have multiple cases to choose from, we can use a switch statement.
	* keep in mind that switch has scope and input limitations 
* Loops
	* We use loops when we need to repeat the same code multiple times in succession.
* Break
	* To exit early from the loop
* Continue
	* Skip the rest of the loop we're in
