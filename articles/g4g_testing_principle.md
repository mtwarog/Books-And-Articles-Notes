**Definition**: process of executing a program with the aim of finding the error  
## Principles of Software Testing
* Testing shows presence of defects
	* Software testing reduces presence of defects. Testing talks about presence of defects, not about the absence of defects.
	* Testing can reduce the number of defects but not removes all defects.
* Exhaustive testing is not possible
	* Exhaustive testing is impossible means the software can never test at every test cases.
* Early testing
	* The defect detected in early phases of SDLC will very less expensive. For better performance of software, software testing will start at initial phase i.e. testing will perform at the requirement analysis phase.
* Defect clustering
	* In a project, a small number of the module can contain most of the defects. Pareto Principle to software testing state that 80% of software defect comes from 20% of modules.
* Pesticide paradox
	* Repeating the same test cases again and again will not find new bugs. So it is necessary to review the test cases and add or update test cases to find new bugs.
* Testing is context dependent
	* Different types of software need to perform different types of testing. For example, The testing of the e-commerce site is different from the testing of the Android application.
* Absence of errors fallacy
	* If a built software is 99% bug-free but it does not follow the user requirement then it is unusable. It is not only necessary that software is 99% bug-free but it also mandatory to fulfill all the customer requirements.
