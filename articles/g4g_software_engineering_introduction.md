**Definition**: Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.
## Dual Role of Software
* As a product
* As a vehicle for delivering a product (e.g. operating system)
## Objectives of Software Engineering
* Maintainability - It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.
* Correctness - software product is correct, if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.
* Reusability - software product has good reusability, if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products
* Testability - software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria
* Reliability - it is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.
* Portability - software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another
* Adaptability - software allows differing system constraints and user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software
## Program vs Software Product
* Program is a set of instruction related each other where as Software Product is a collection of program designed for specific task.
* Programs are usually small in size where as Software Products are usually large in size.
