# F# language
* is a functional programming language
* F# programming primarily involves defining types and functions that are type-inferred and generalized automatically. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming.
## F# sample features
* Lightweight syntax
* Immutable by default
* Type inference and automatic generalization
* First-class functions
* Powerful data types
* Pattern matching
* Async programming
## Misc
* Enforced correctness with functions and pattern matching
* MS Product (runs on CLR (equivalent of JVM in .net platform) like C#)
